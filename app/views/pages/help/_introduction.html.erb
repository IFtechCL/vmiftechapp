<h3>Why should I choose your SSD Instances instead of a Shared Hosting or a dedicated Server?</h3>
<p>The first reason is price. We provide virtual servers for a very low competitive price.<br><br>Unlike shared hosting,you have full root access to your server,you're free to do anything you want with it(as long as you don't violate our Terms of Service) and you're guaranteed the resource that is advertised whereas in shared hosting multiple users share the same server.<br><br>Another advantage is that you can easily scale your servers in the future within minutes which would be difficult to do with a dedicated box.

<h3>What kind of Network Connection does my Instance run on?</h3>
<p>All instances are connected to 1 gigabit per second ethernet switches.</p>

<h3>What virtualization technology does LiDeploy uses for its servers?</h3>
<p>We use KVM virtualization for all of our server which provides great performance and security.</p>

<h3>Do you provide Windows based servers?</h3>
<p>We do not provide Windows based servers.</p>
